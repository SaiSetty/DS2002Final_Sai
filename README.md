# DS2002Final_Sai
This is the repository for my final DS 2002 capstone project. 
There is a final_data folder that contains batch and stream data. This folder needs to be uploaded to DBFS in databricks before running the ipynb file in databricks.
There is a classic_data_mart.sql file. This file needs to be imported and run in MySQL Workbench account connected to the ipynb file before running the ipynb file.
There is a .ipynb file. This file is the main databricks notebook that has all the code to run the DS 2002 Final Project.
